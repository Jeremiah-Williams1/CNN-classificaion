# Dog vs Cat Image Classification 🐶🐱

This project implements a uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Tensorflow/Keras to classify images of dogs and cats.

The project was  done in 3 steps 
1. using a normal CNN of Conv2D layers and MaxPooling
2. Using a pretrained model vgg16 as is
3. Using a fine-tuned Vgg16 model (i.e not traning some layers)


some data augmentaion was done on the dataset since the dataset was relatively small


Dataset was from kaggle: (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats)
